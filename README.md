# E-Sign Service Solutions POC

### Pre-requisites

You need to make sure the following are installed in your computer and they should be available at your command line:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

  Check the availability by running the following command:

  ```shell
  $ node --version
  ```

  If it's OK, it should yield the Node's version number (e.g. `v10.16.3`)

## Steps to Run the App

To have the app running on your machine, you simply need to run a few command on your command line.

- Clone this repository into your machine:
  ```shell
  $ git clone https://github.com/jcarias/ess-poc.git
  ```
- Install the App's dependencies by running the following command inside the cloned dir:
  ```shell
  $ npm install
  ```
- Finally, launch the App (this should open the computer's default browser).
  ```shell
  $ npm run start
  ```

The default address is `http://localhost:3000/`
